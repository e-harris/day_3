#### Cognitive Biases

The mind is an operating system
 - Multiple processes running at the same time
 - won’t always work properly

##### Too much Information
 - Anchoring (relying too much on First impressions)
 - Confirmation Bias (Searching for info to confirm your theory)
 - Choice-supportive bias (prioritising what makes you happy/what you know)

##### Not Enough Meaning
 - Authority Bias (Person of authority, so must be correct, rather than trusting 													your own information)
 - Outcome Bias (Judge situation on outcome rather decision)
 - bandwagon effect (Going with the flow)

#### Exploiting bias in workplace

##### Reactance
 - Telling people they can so no makes them more likely to say yes

##### Reciprocity
 - Be the first to give obligation to give when they receive

##### Door in the face
 - Forcing people to refuse a large request increases the likelihood of agreeing to a second smaller request

##### Likeability
 - Give compliments to build cooperation

##### Bystander effect
 - People look to others to determine their own problems
